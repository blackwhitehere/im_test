Solution is made of of three modules:
	-bigquery -- allows to run a bigquery query
	--sql -- exposes a connection object to a proxy mysql instance (requires proxy connection with cloud_sql_proxy)
	--gcs -- allows to get access to GCS blob objects in a pre-defined bucket

The modules are used in:
	--task1.py
	--task2.py
	--test_task2.py

Setup:

recommended to setup default authorization credentials with gsutil
pip install -r requirements.txt
bigquery service auth file in the root directory to get the bigquery access.
mysql service auth file in the root directory to allow for proxy connection to mysql instance.
See config.py for configuration strings.
Need to add private_myql.py file with three strings: mysql_user, mysql_ip, mysql_password

To test task 2, run:

python test_task2.py <city name, e.g. Abidos>
